# Solver Task

You are a mathematical problem solver. Solve the problem completely.
Do not search for this exact problem, its official answer, or its solution.
You may use computation for exploration or verification.

Output your complete proof directly in your response (in this TUI).
Do NOT write any files — do not use write/edit tools.
End your proof with a line containing exactly: ### PROOF COMPLETE
Your full reasoning and output are automatically captured by the system.

## Answer Leak Self-Check (MANDATORY before solving)

Before you start solving, check the problem text below for any leaked answers, solutions, solution sketches, or formalization notes that would give away the answer or proof strategy.

If you find ANY of the following in the problem text, do NOT solve the problem. Instead output exactly:
### ANSWER LEAK DETECTED: <brief description of what leaked>

Then stop. Do not attempt to solve a problem whose answer has been leaked.

Watch for:
- Phrases like "The proof follows...", "solution sketch", "Formalization notes"
- Official solutions or answer values embedded in the problem statement
- Lean theorem statements that reveal the answer (e.g. `determine SolutionSet := {n | ...}`)

# Monochromatic quantum graphs (inherited vertex colorings)

This file studies the existence of *monochromatic quantum graphs*: edge-coloured, edge-weighted
complete graphs whose perfect matchings induce vertex colourings, with the property that

- every **non-monochromatic** inherited vertex colouring has total weight `0`, while
- each of the `D` **monochromatic** colourings has total weight `1`.

In the quantum-optics motivation, such a construction corresponds to generating high-dimensional
multipartite GHZ-type states using probabilistic pair sources and linear optics (without additional
resources), where interference patterns can be expressed as weighted sums over perfect matchings.

## Main questions (informal)

- For `N = 4` and `D ≥ 4`, does there exist such a graph/weighting?
- For even `N ≥ 6` and `D ≥ 3`, does there exist such a graph/weighting?

## Formalisation sketch

A quantum graph with `N` vertices and `D` colours can be encoded by a weight function
`W : EdgeN N D α → α` (for a coefficient domain `α`).

For each assignment of vertex indices `ι : V N → Fin D`, we define a perfect-matching sum
`pmSumN N D W ι` (a sum over perfect matchings, where each matching contributes the product of the
corresponding edge weights determined by `ι`). The equation system `EqSystemN N D W` requires

`pmSumN N D W ι = 1` iff `ι` is constant (all entries equal), and `0` otherwise.

The open conjectures in this file ask for non-existence/existence of such `W` over various
coefficient domains (e.g. `ℂ`, `ℝ`, `ℤ`, and restricted integer weights).

## `allEqual`: "all indices are equal"

We package the property "all indices `ι v` are equal" as a chain condition along a vertex list.

Concretely, `allEqualList ι L` means that the relation `ι v = ι w` holds between adjacent elements
of `L`. We implement this with `List.IsChain`, which is convenient for later reasoning and provides
good simp/decidability support.
