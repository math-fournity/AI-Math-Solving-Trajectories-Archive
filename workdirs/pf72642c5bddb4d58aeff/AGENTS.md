# Solver Task

You are a mathematical problem solver. Solve the problem completely.
Do not search for this exact problem, its official answer, or its solution.
You may use computation for exploration or verification.

Output your complete proof directly in your response (in this TUI).
Do NOT write any files — do not use write/edit tools.
End your proof with a line containing exactly: ### PROOF COMPLETE
Your full reasoning and output are automatically captured by the system.

## Answer Leak Self-Check (MANDATORY before solving)

Before you start solving, check the problem text below for any leaked answers, solutions, solution sketches, or formalization notes that would give away the answer or proof strategy.

If you find ANY of the following in the problem text, do NOT solve the problem. Instead output exactly:
### ANSWER LEAK DETECTED: <brief description of what leaked>

Then stop. Do not attempt to solve a problem whose answer has been leaked.

Watch for:
- Phrases like "The proof follows...", "solution sketch", "Formalization notes"
- Official solutions or answer values embedded in the problem statement
- Lean theorem statements that reveal the answer (e.g. `determine SolutionSet := {n | ...}`)

## Problem

# Problem

In a remote sector of the galaxy, a massive, perfectly spherical space station serves as a refueling hub. The station has a total circumference of 60 megameters. To facilitate transport, three frictionless magnetic rail loops are constructed around the station, each forming a great circle (a path whose center coincides with the center of the station).

The first rail loop is installed along the station's equator. The other two rail loops are longitudinal, both passing through the station's North and South poles. These two longitudinal loops are positioned such that they intersect each other at a 90-degree angle.

Three transport vessels, each of an identical length $L$, operate on these tracks. There is exactly one vessel per track, and all three vessels travel at the exact same constant speed. Because the tracks intersect at various junctions, the flight controllers must ensure the vessels never occupy the same point in space at the same time to avoid a collision.

Assuming the vessels can be synchronized perfectly to minimize the risk of impact, what is the maximum possible value of the length $L$ that allows these three vessels to travel indefinitely without ever crashing into one another?

## 解题约束（必须严格遵守）

1. **不要使用任何工具**——不要写文件、不要执行命令、不要搜索、不要浏览网页、不要读取文件。
   你只需要在TUI中用thinking来解题。所有推理过程在你的思维中完成。

2. **直接在TUI中输出证明**——不要创建任何文件，不要使用任何工具调用。
   完成证明后，在TUI中直接输出（必须用英文原文，不要翻译成中文）：

   ### PROOF COMPLETE

3. **如果你无法做出这道题**，直接说（必须用英文原文）：

   ### I CANNOT SOLVE THIS

4. **如果你发现题目中包含了答案**（答案泄漏），直接说：

   ### ANSWER LEAK DETECTED

以上是全部约束。现在请解题。
