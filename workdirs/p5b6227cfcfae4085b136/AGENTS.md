# Solver Task

You are a mathematical problem solver. Solve the problem completely.
Do not search for this exact problem, its official answer, or its solution.
You may use computation for exploration or verification.

Output your complete proof directly in your response (in this TUI).
Do NOT write any files — do not use write/edit tools.
End your proof with a line containing exactly: ### PROOF COMPLETE
Your full reasoning and output are automatically captured by the system.

## Answer Leak Self-Check (MANDATORY before solving)

Before you start solving, check the problem text below for any leaked answers, solutions, solution sketches, or formalization notes that would give away the answer or proof strategy.

If you find ANY of the following in the problem text, do NOT solve the problem. Instead output exactly:
### ANSWER LEAK DETECTED: <brief description of what leaked>

Then stop. Do not attempt to solve a problem whose answer has been leaked.

Watch for:
- Phrases like "The proof follows...", "solution sketch", "Formalization notes"
- Official solutions or answer values embedded in the problem statement
- Lean theorem statements that reveal the answer (e.g. `determine SolutionSet := {n | ...}`)

## Problem

# Problem

A high-tech manufacturing plant operates four specialized production lines labeled Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. To maintain operations for one cycle, the plant manager allocates a total of 100 energy units across these lines. Let the energy assigned to Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta be represented by the variables $a, b, c,$ and $d$ respectively, where each allocation is a non-negative real number such that $a + b + c + d = 100$.

The efficiency score $S$ of the plant is determined by the sum of four departmental outputs. Each department's output is calculated as the cube root of the ratio between its primary line’s energy and the energy of a neighboring line plus a fixed overhead of 7 units. Specifically, the efficiency score is defined as:
$$S = \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{c+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{d+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{d}{a+7}}$$

If the maximum possible efficiency score achievable by optimizing the energy distribution is $M$, calculate the value of $M^3$.

## 解题约束（必须严格遵守）

1. **不要使用任何工具**——不要写文件、不要执行命令、不要搜索、不要浏览网页、不要读取文件。
   你只需要在TUI中用thinking来解题。所有推理过程在你的思维中完成。

2. **直接在TUI中输出证明**——不要创建任何文件，不要使用任何工具调用。
   完成证明后，在TUI中直接输出（必须用英文原文，不要翻译成中文）：

   ### PROOF COMPLETE

3. **如果你无法做出这道题**，直接说（必须用英文原文）：

   ### I CANNOT SOLVE THIS

4. **如果你发现题目中包含了答案**（答案泄漏），直接说：

   ### ANSWER LEAK DETECTED

以上是全部约束。现在请解题。
